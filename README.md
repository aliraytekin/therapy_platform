# üß† Therapy Platform

A full-stack web application inspired by **[moka.care](https://moka.care/)**, built to demonstrate my skills and determination after applying for their Junior Full-Stack Engineer position.

This platform connects users with therapists, allowing them to search, filter, and book therapy sessions online.
